In order to keep this as short as possible I'll mostly focus on how things work and leave out a lot of details. So, what we'll do is create a data structure and see if we can follow the rules on the specification.<h2 id=tagged-unions>Tagged Unions</h2><p>Also known as <em>variants</em>, is a data structure that can represent different states of a single type. At any given time it can only be in one of those states. Other important features include the ability to carry information about themselves as well as an extra "payload" that can hold anything.<p>It sounds cool until we realize we don't have those things in javascript. If we want to use them we'll have to recreate them. Fortunately for us we don't need a bulletproof implementation. We just need to deal with a couple of things, the type of the variant and the payload they should carry. We can handle that.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>function</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> Union</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>types</span><span style=color:#9cabca>) {</span></span>

<span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#9cabca>}</span></span></code></pre><p>What do we have here? You can think of <code>Union</code> as a factory of constructor functions. It takes a list of variants and for each it will create a constructor. It looks better in an example. Let's say we want to model the states of a task, using <code>Union</code> we could create this.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>const</span><span> Status</span><span style=color:#e6c384> =</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> Union</span><span style=color:#9cabca>([</span><span style=color:#98bb6c>'Success'</span><span style=color:#9cabca>,</span><span style=color:#98bb6c> 'Failed'</span><span style=color:#9cabca>,</span><span style=color:#98bb6c> 'Pending'</span><span style=color:#9cabca>]);</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can create our <code>Status</code> variants.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span>Status</span><span style=color:#9cabca>.</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8>Success</span><span style=color:#9cabca>({</span><span> some</span><span style=color:#9cabca>:</span><span style=color:#98bb6c> 'stuff'</span><span style=color:#9cabca> });</span></span>
<span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#727169>// { "type": "Success", "data": { "some": "stuff" } }</span></span></code></pre><p>As you can see here we have a function that returns a plain object. In this object we have a <code>type</code> key where we store the name of our variant. The <code>data</code> key will hold anything we can think of. You might think that storing just the name of the variant isn't enough, because it may cause collisions with other variants of different types and you would be right. Since we are only going to create one data type this is not an issue for us.<p>If you find this pattern useful and want to use it, you'll need something reliable, consider using a library like <a rel="noopener external" href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/tagmeme target=_blank>tagmeme</a> or <a rel="noopener external" href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/daggy target=_blank>daggy</a> or something else.<h2 id=fantasy-land>Fantasy Land</h2><p>The github description says the following.<blockquote><p>Specification for interoperability of common algebraic structures in JavaScript</blockquote><p>Algebraic structures? What? I know. The wikipedia definition for that doesn't help much either. Best I can offer is a vague sentence that leaves you with the least amount of questions, here I go: A set of values that have some operations associated with them that follow certain rules.<p>In our case, you can think the variants as our "set of values" and the functions that we create will be the "operations," as far as the rules goes we follow the Fantasy Land specification.<h2 id=the-link>The Link</h2><p>So, we know about tagged unions and we have a vague idea about this Fantasy Land thing but know the question remains, how do we connect those two? The answer is <em>pattern matching</em>. Those familiar with the term also know that we don't have that in javascript. Sadly, in this case we can only mimic certain features.<p>How do we start? Let's just describe what we need. We need to evaluate a variant, be able to determine which type we have and execute a block of code. We already have the <code>type</code> key which is a <code>String</code>, with that we could just use a <code>switch/case</code>.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>switch</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>status</span><span style=color:#9cabca>.</span><span style=color:#e6c384>type</span><span style=color:#9cabca>) {</span></span>

<span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#9cabca>}</span></span></code></pre><p>This actually gets pretty close to what we want but there is a problem, it doesn't return anything. We want to do the same this <code>switch/case</code> does but inside an expression, something that yields a result. To recreate this behavior in the way we want we'll use objects and functions.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>function</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> match</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>value</span><span style=color:#9cabca>,</span><span> patterns</span><span style=color:#9cabca>) {</span></span>

<span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#9cabca>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Once again we take advantage of the fact that <code>type</code> is a <code>String</code> and use it to "choose" the pattern that we want. This time around our patterns are inside an object. Now, each "pattern" will be associated with a method on the <code>patterns</code> object and our function <code>match</code> will return what the chosen pattern returns. If it can't find the pattern it will try to call a method with the name <code>_</code>, this will mimic the <code>default</code> keyword on the <code>switch/case</code> and if that fails it just returns <code>null</code>. With this we can have the behavior we want.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#7e9cd8>match</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>status</span><span style=color:#9cabca>, {</span></span>

We are going to model a fairly popular concept, an action that might fail. To do this we'll create a union with two variants <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>, we will call it <code>Result</code>. The idea is simple, <code>Ok</code> will represent a success and we'll use it to carry the "expected" value, all our operations will be based on this variant. On the other hand if we get a variant of type <code>Err</code> all we want to do is propagate the error, this means that we'll ignore any kind of transformation on this variant.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>const</span><span> Result</span><span style=color:#e6c384> =</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> Union</span><span style=color:#9cabca>([</span><span style=color:#98bb6c>'Ok'</span><span style=color:#9cabca>,</span><span style=color:#98bb6c> 'Err'</span><span style=color:#9cabca>]);</span></span></code></pre><h2 id=the-operations>The Operations</h2><p>Before we move on let's just do one more thing, let's create a <code>match</code> function specific to our data type.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span>Result</span><span style=color:#9cabca>.</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8>match</span><span style=color:#e6c384> =</span><span style=color:#957fb8> function</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>err</span><span style=color:#9cabca>,</span><span> ok</span><span style=color:#9cabca>,</span><span> data</span><span style=color:#9cabca>) {</span></span>

<span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#9cabca>};</span></span></code></pre><p>Okay, now everything is in place. So like I said before, we will focus on just one branch of the Fantasy Land specification and that will be the one that goes from <code>Functor</code> to <code>Monad</code>. For each operation we will implement a static method in our <code>Result</code> object and I'll try to explain how does it work and why is useful.<p>Logic dictates that we start with Functor but we are going to take another road.<h3 id=chain>Chain</h3><p>The <code>chain</code> operation lets us interact with the value that's inside our structure and apply a transformation. Sounds easy, right? We do that all the time, but this time we have rules. I present to you the first law of the day.<ul><li>Associativity</ul><pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span>Val</span><span style=color:#9cabca>.</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8>chain</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>Fx</span><span style=color:#9cabca>).</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8>chain</span><span style=color:#9cabca>(</span><span>Gx</span><span style=color:#9cabca>);</span></span>

In the first statement notice that it reads like a sequence, it goes one after the other. In the second statement it's like one operation wraps around the other. And this part is interesting, <code>Fx(value).chain(Gx)</code>. That second <code>chain</code> comes directly from <code>Fx</code>. We can tell that <code>Fx</code> and <code>Gx</code> are functions that return a data type that also follows this law.<p>Let's see this in practice with another data type everyone is familiar with, arrays. It turns out that arrays follow this law (sorta). I know there is no <code>chain</code> in the <code>Array</code> prototype but there is a <code>flatMap</code> which behaves just like it.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>const</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> to_uppercase</span><span style=color:#e6c384> =</span><span style=color:#9cabca> (</span><span>str</span><span style=color:#9cabca>)</span><span style=color:#957fb8> =></span><span> str</span><span style=color:#9cabca>.</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8>toUpperCase</span><span style=color:#9cabca>();</span></span>

Pay attention to that function on the first statement, <code>v => v</code>, you know this one, right? We've used it before, it is known as the <code>identity</code> function. So, in math an identity element is a neutral value that has no effect on the result of the operation and this is exactly what this function does (nothing). But the interesting part is not on the surface, is what we can't see. If the first statement has the same effect as the second, then it means that <code>.map(v => v)</code> returns another value of the same type, it does that even if we give it the most useless function we could possibly imagine. Let's show this again using arrays as an example.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>const</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> identity</span><span style=color:#e6c384> =</span><span style=color:#9cabca> (</span><span>arg</span><span style=color:#9cabca>)</span><span style=color:#957fb8> =></span><span> arg</span><span style=color:#9cabca>;</span></span>

That first statement is the most confusing thing we've seen so far. This time it looks like <code>Fx</code> and <code>Gx</code> are not functions, they are data structures. <code>Gx</code> has an <code>.ap</code> method so it must be the same type as <code>Val</code>. And if go further we can tell that <code>Fx</code> has a <code>map</code> method, that means is a Functor. So for this to work <code>Val</code>, <code>Fx</code> and <code>Gx</code> must implement the Functor and Apply specification. The last piece of the puzzle is this <code>Fx.map(fx => ... fx(...))</code>, there are functions involve but they are inside a data structure.<p>The name of this law and that second statement suggest this is about function composition. I'm thinking that this should behave just like <code>.map</code> but with a plot twist, the callback we get it's trapped inside a Functor.

This solves a very specific problem, one that could happen very often if we use Functors and that is nested structures.<p>Say we want to retrieve a <code>config</code> object that we have in <code>localStorage</code>. We know this action can fail that's why we created a function that uses our <code>Result</code> variant.<pre class=giallo style=color:#dcd7ba;background-color:#1f1f28><code data-lang=javascript><span class=giallo-l><span style=color:#957fb8>function</span><span style=color:#7e9cd8> get_config</span><span style=color:#9cabca>() {</span></span>
