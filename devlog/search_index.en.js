you ever heard the term \"pure function\"? What about \"side effects\"? If you have then probably you've heard that side effects are evil and should be avoided at all cost (just like var.) Here is the problem, if you write javascript you probably want to cause those side effects (specially if you get paid to write javascript) So the solution here is not to avoid all the side effects but to control them. I going to show you a few things that you can do to make your pure functions and your side effects get along just fine.\nBefore we start let us just do a little recap on some terms, so we can all be in the same page.\nConcepts\nPure function\nFor the sake of simplicity let us say that a pure function is a function whose output is only determined by its input and has no observable effect on the outside world. The main benefit they provide (in my opinion) is predictibility, if you give them the same input values they will always return you the same output. Lets look at some examples.\nThis one is pure.\nfunction increment(number) {\n  return number + 1;\n}\n\nThis one isn't\nMath.random();\n\nAnd these are tricky.\nconst A_CONSTANT = 1;\n\nfunction increment(number) {\n  return number + A_CONSTANT;\n}\n\nmodule.exports ={\n  increment\n};\nfunction a_constant() {\n  return 1;\n}\n\nfunction increment(number) {\n  return number + a_constant();\n}\nSide effects\nI will call a side effect to anything that compromises the \"pureness\" of a function. The list includes but is not limited to:\n\nChanging (mutate) an external variable in any way.\nShowing things in the screen.\nWriting to a file.\nMaking an http request.\nSpawn a process.\nSaving data in a database.\nCalling other functions with side-effects.\nDOM manipulation.\nRandomness.\n\nSo, any action that can change the \"state of the world\" is a side effect.\nHow do we use those things together?\nYou're probably still thinking about that side effect list, is basically everything javascript is good for and yet some people still tell you to avoid them. Don't fear I come bearing suggestions.\nGood old function composition\nAnother way of saying it will be: good old separation of concerns. This is the non complicated way. If there is a way to break apart a computation from a side effect then put the computation on a function and give the output to the function/block that has the side effect.\nIt could be as simple as doing something like this.\nfunction some_process() {\n  const data = get_data_somehow();\n  const clean_data = computation(data);\n  const result = save(clean_data);\n\n  return result;\n}\n\nNow, some_process still isn't pure but that's okay, we are writing javascript we don't need everything to be pure, what we need is to keep our sanity. By splitting the side effects from the pure computation we have created three independent functions that solve only one problem at a time.  You could even take it one step further and use a helper function like pipe to get rid of those intermediate variables and compose those functions directly.\nconst some_process = pipe(get_data_somehow, computation, save);\n\nBut now we have created another problem, what happens when we want to make a side effect in the middle of one those? What do we do? Well if a helper function created the problem then I say use another helper function to get out of it. Something like this would work.\nfunction tap(fn) {\n  return function (arg) {\n    fn(arg);\n    return arg;\n  }\n}\n\nThis will allow you place a function with a side effect in the middle of chain of functions while keeping data flow.\nconst some_process = pipe(\n  get_data_somehow,\n  tap(console.log),\n  computation,\n  tap(a_side_effect),\n  save\n);\n\nThere is argument to be made against these type of things, some people would argue that now all your logic is scattered all over the place and that you have to move around to actually know what the function does. I really don't mind, it's a matter of preference. But enough about that, lets talk about tap's signature, look at it tap(fn) it takes a callback as a parameter lets see how we can use that to our advantage.\nMake someone else handle the problem\nAs we all know life isn't always so simple, sometimes we just can't make that sweet pipeline of functions. In some situations we need to do some side-effect in the middle of a process and when that happens we can always cheat. In javascript we can treat functions as values which lets us do funny things like passing functions as parameters to other functions. This way the function can have the flexibility to execute a side effect when we need to while maintaining some of the predictibility that we know and love.\nSay for example that you have a function that is already pure and does something to a collection of data but now for some reason you need log the original and the transformed values right after the transformation happens. What you can do is add a function as a parameter and call it in the right moment.\nfunction transform(onchange, data) {\n  let result = Array.isArray(data) ? [] : {};\n  for(let key in data) {\n    result[key] = data[key] + 1;\n    onchange(data[key], result[key]);\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n\nThis tecnically fulfills some of the requirements of a pure function, the output (and behavior) of the function is still determined by its input, it just so happens that one of those inputs is a function that can trigger any side effect.  Again, the goal in here is not to fight against the nature of javascript and have everything be 100% pure, we want to control when the side effect happens. So in this case the one who controls whether or not to have side effects is the caller of the function. One extra benefit of this is that if you want to use that function in a unit test to prove that still works as expected the only thing you'll need to do is supply its arguments, you don't have grab any mocking library to test it. \nYou may be wondering why put the callback as the first parameter, this is really about personal preference. If you put the thing that changes the most frecuently in the last position you make it easier to do partial application, that is binding the values of the parameters without executing the function. For example you could use transform.bind to create a specialized function which already has the onchange callback.\nLazy effects\nThe idea here is to delay the inevitable. Instead of performing the side effect right away what you do is provide a way for the caller of your function to execute the side-effect when they see fit. You can do this in a couple of ways.\nUsing function wrappers\nAs I mentioned before in javascript you can treat functions as values and one thing you can do with values is returning them from functions. I'm talking about functions that return functions. We already saw how usefull that can be and if you think about is not that crazy, how many times have you seen something like this?\nfunction Stuff(thing) {\n  \n  // setup\n\n  return {\n    some_method() {\n      // code...\n    },\n    other() {\n      // code...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis is an old school \"constructor.\" Before, in the good ol' days of ES5, this was one way of emulating classes. Is a regular function that returns an object, and is we all know objects can have methods. What we want to do is little bit like that, we want convert the block that contains the side effect into a function and return it.\nfunction some_process(config) {\n\n  /*\n   * do some pure computation with config\n   */\n\n  return function _effect() {\n   /*\n    * do whatever you want in here\n    */ \n  }\n}\n\nThis way we give the caller of our function the oportunity to use the side effect when they want, and they can even pass it around and compose it with other functions. Interestingly enough this is not a very common pattern, maybe because there are other ways to achieve the same goal.\nUsing data structures\nAnother way to create lazy effects is to wrap a side effect inside a data structure. What we want to do is to treat our effects as regular data, have the ability to manipulate them and even chain other effects in safe way (I mean without executing them). You've probably seen this before, one example that I can think of is Observables. Take a look at this code that uses rxjs.\n// taken from:\n// https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/creation/create.html\n\n/*\n  Increment value every 1s, emit even numbers.\n*/\nconst evenNumbers = Observable.create(function(observer) {\n  let value = 0;\n  const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {\n    if (value % 2 === 0) {\n      observer.next(value);\n    }\n    value++;\n  }, 1000);\n\n  return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);\n});\n\nThe result of Observable.create not only delays the execution of setInterval but also gives you the ability to call evenNumbers.pipe to chain other observables that can also have other side effects. Now of course Observables and rxjs aren't the only way, we can create our own effect type. If we want to create one all we need is a function to execute the effect and another one that lets us compose effects.\nfunction Effect(effect) {\n  return {\n    run(...args) {\n      return effect(...args);\n    },\n    map(fn) {\n      return Effect(arg =&gt; fn(effect(arg)));\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n\nIt may not look like much but this is actually enough to be useful. You can start to composing your effects without triggering any changes to the environment. You can now do stuff like this.\nconst persist = (data) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`saving ${data} to a database...`);\n  return data.length ? true : false;\n};\nconst show_message = result =&gt; result \n  ? console.log('we good') \n  : console.log('we not good');\n\nconst save = Effect(persist).map(show_message);\n\nsave.run('some stuff');\n// saving some stuff to a database...\n// we good\n\nsave.run('');\n// saving  to a database...\n// we not good \n\nIf you have used Array.map to compose data transformations you'll be feeling right at home when using Effect, all you have to do is provide the functions with the side effect and at the of the chain the resulting Effect will know what to do when you are ready to call it.\nI've only scratched the surface of what you can do with Effect, if you want to learn more try to search the term functor and IO Monad, I promise you is going to be fun. \nWhat now?\nNow you click on the link in the end of the post, it's a really good article (basically a better version of this one). \nI hope now you are confident enough to start writing pure functions in your code and combine them with the convenient side effects that javascript lets you do.\nSources\n\nHow to deal with dirty side effects in your pure functional JavaScript\n\n","id":"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/dealing-with-side-effects-and-pure-functions-in-javascript/","title":"Dealing with side effects and pure functions in javascript"},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/functional-programming-for-your-everyday-javascript-partial-application/":{"body":"Today we are here to solve a mystery, the mystery of why some people choose to create functions that take a callback as the first argument. You might be thinking that the answer is partial application and you would be half right, but partial application is just the means to an end, the real reason to do such a thing is to enable a \"better\" function composition. But before we get into details of partial application let's explore how we do things now.\nHow we do things\nWhen we create a function we usually sort the arguments by some kind of importance/priority level, where the most important goes first. As a result, when we create a function that works on a piece of data it becomes the first thing on the list, it's followed by less important configuration arguments and the last thing are optional arguments that we can omit. \nSay that we want to create a function that picks specific properties from a plain object. Let's think of what we need. The object, that was your first thought? It's natural, you don't want to omit it by accident when you call the function. That leaves the keys that we are going to choose as the last argument.\nfunction pick(obj, keys) {\n  let result = {};\n  \n  for(key of keys) {\n    result[key] = obj[key];\n  }\n  \n  return result;\n}\n\n\nNote: We are not the only ones that think like this, check out lodash pick\n\nNow, say that we have a user object and we want to hide any \"sensitive\" data. We would use it like this.\nconst user = {\n  id: 7,\n  name: \"Tom\",\n  lastname: \"Keen\",\n  email: \"noreply@example.com\",\n  password: \"hudson\"\n};\n\npick(user, ['name', 'lastname']); \n\n// { name: \"Tom\", lastname: \"Keen\" }\n\nThat works great, but what happens when we need to work with an array of users? \nconst users = [\n  {\n    id: 7,\n    name: \"Tom\",\n    lastname: \"Keen\",\n    email: \"noreply@example.com\",\n    password: \"hudson\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: 30,\n    name: \"Smokey\",\n    lastname: \"Putnum\",\n    email: \"noreply@example.com\",\n    password: \"carnival\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: 69,\n    name: \"Lady\",\n    lastname: \"Luck\",\n    email: \"noreply@example.com\",\n    password: \"norestforthewicked\"\n  }\n];\n\nWe are force to iterate over the array and apply the function.\nusers.map(function(user) {\n  return pick(user, ['name', 'lastname']);\n});\n\n/*\n[\n  {\"name\": \"Tom\", \"lastname\": \"Keen\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Smokey\", \"lastname\": \"Putnum\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Lady\", \"lastname\": \"Luck\"}\n]\n*/\n\nIs not that bad. And you know what? That callback actually looks useful. We could put it in another place and give it a name.\nfunction public_info(user) {\n  return pick(user, ['name', 'lastname']);\n}\n\nusers.map(public_info);\n\nWhat is actually happening? What we do here is bind the second argument to the function with the value ['name', 'lastname'] and force pick to wait for the user data to be executed. \nNow let's take this example one step further, pretend that Async/Await doesn't exists and that the users array comes from a Promise, maybe an http requests using fetch. What do we do?\nfetch(url).then(function(users) {\n  users.map(function(user) {\n    return pick(user, ['name', 'lastname']);\n  })\n});\n\nNow that is bad. Maybe some arrow functions can make it better?\nfetch(url).then(users =&gt; users.map(user =&gt; pick(user, ['name', 'lastname'])));\n\nIs it better? A question for another day. We prepared for this, we have the public_info function let's use it.\nfetch(url).then(users =&gt; users.map(public_info));\n\nThis is acceptable, I like it. If we wanted we could make another function that binds public_info to .map.\nfunction user_list(users) {\n  return users.map(public_info);\n}\n\nSo now we get.\nfetch(url).then(user_list);\n\nLet's see everything we needed for that.\nfunction pick(obj, keys) {\n  // code...\n}\n\nfunction public_info(user) {\n  return pick(user, ['name', 'lastname']);\n}\n\nfunction user_list(users) {\n  return users.map(public_info);\n}\n\nfetch(url).then(user_list);\n\nWhat if I told you that we can create public_info and user_list in another way? What if we could have this?\nconst public_info = pick(['name', 'lastname']);\nconst user_list = map(public_info);\n\nfetch(url).then(user_list);\n\nOr put everything inline if that is your jam.\nfetch(url).then(map(pick(['name', 'lastname'])));\n\nWe can have it but first we'll need to change the way we think about functions a little bit. \nThinking differently\nInstead of thinking of priority we should start thinking in dependencies and data. When you're creating a function just ask yourself, out of all this arguments what is the most likely to change? Put that as your last argument.\nLet's make a function that takes the first elements of something. What do we need? We need that \"something\" and also the number of elements we are going to take. Of those two, which is most likely to change? It's the data, that \"something\".\nfunction take(count, data) {\n  return data.slice(0, count);\n}\n\nIn a normal situation you would use it like this.\ntake(2, ['first', 'second', 'rest']);\n\n// [\"first\", \"second\"]\n\nBut with a little bit of magic (which will be revealed soon) you can reuse it like this.\nconst first_two = take(2);\n\nfirst_two(['first', 'second', 'rest']);\n\nThis way ordering your arguments gets even more convenient when callbacks are involved. Let's \"reverse\" Array.filter arguments and see what we can do.\nfunction filter(func, data) {\n  return data.filter(func);\n}\n\nWe start simple, exclude falsey values from an array.\nfilter(Boolean, [true, '', null, 'that']);\n\n// =&gt; [ true, \"that\" ]\n\nThat's good and it could be better if we add more context.\nconst exclude_falsey = filter(Boolean);\n\nexclude_falsey([true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nI'm hoping you can see the posibilities that this kind of pattern can provide. There are libraries (like Ramda) that use this approach to build complex functions by assembling smaller single purpose utilities. \nEnough talking, let's see now how we can do this ourselves.\nThis is the way\nLike with everything in javascript you can do this in a million ways, some are more convenient than others, some require a little bit of magic. Let us begin.\nThe built-in magic of bind\nTurns out that we don't need to do anything extraordinary to bind values to the arguments of a function because every function has a method called bind. The syntax is not as convenient as the one I showed but it gets close. Another thing that you have to be aware of is that the first argument to Function.bind is the \"context\", that is the value of the keyword this inside the function. This is the basic usage.\nconst exclude_falsey = filter.bind(null, Boolean);\n\nexclude_falsey([true, '', null, 'that']);\nThe magic within\nThis one requires some work and it involves another enigmatic keyword, the arguments. What we will do is leverage the fact that arguments is an array-like structure that has a length, we will count the argument the function gets and if its less than what we want we return another function. Sounds confusing?\nfunction filter(func, data) {\n\n  // This is it. We are counting.\n  if(arguments.length === 1) {\n    // if .length is 1 that means we got `func`\n    // it also means we don't have `data`\n    // so we return another function that\n    // remembers `func` and wait for `data`\n    return arg =&gt; filter(func, arg);\n  }\n\n  return data.filter(func);\n}\n\nNow it is possible to do this.\nconst exclude_falsey = filter(Boolean);\n\nexclude_falsey([true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nAnd also.\nfilter(Boolean, [true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nIsn't that nice?\nA simple approach?\nAnd of course we can also create our bind utility. With the help of the spread operator we can collect arguments and simply apply them to a callback. \nfunction bind(func, ...first_args) {\n  return (...rest) =&gt; func(...first_args, ...rest);\n}\n\nThe first step gets the function and collects a list of arguments into an array, then we return a function that collects another list of arguments and finally call func with everything.\nconst exclude_falsey = bind(filter, Boolean);\n\nexclude_falsey([true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nThe cool thing about this one is that if you flip first_args with rest you have a bind_last function.\nNo more magic\nI do have mixed feelings about this one but it really is the most simple.\nfunction filter(func) {\n  return function(data) {\n    return data.filter(func);\n  }\n}\n\nWhich is equivalent to this.\nconst filter = func =&gt; data =&gt; data.filter(func);\n\nThe idea is to take one argument at a time in separate functions. Basically, keep returning functions until you have all the arguments you need. This is what people call \"currying\". How do you use it?\nconst exclude_falsey = filter(Boolean);\n\nexclude_falsey([true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nThat is one case. This is the other.\nfilter (Boolean) ([true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nNotice the extra pair of parenthesis? That's the second function. You'll need one pair for each argument you provide.\nCurry it for me\nGoing back to subject of magic, you can \"automate\" the process of currying using a helper function.\nfunction curry(fn, arity) {\n  if (arguments.length === 1) {\n    // Guess how many arguments\n    // the function needs.\n    // This doesn't always work.\n    arity = fn.length;\n  }\n\n  // Omit `fn` and `arity`, gather the rest\n  const rest = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 2);\n\n  // Do have what we need?\n  if (arity &lt;= rest.length) {\n    return fn.apply(fn, rest);\n  }\n\n  // Execute `curry.bind` with `fn`, `arity` and `rest` as arguments\n  // it will return a function waiting for more arguments\n  return curry.bind.apply(curry, [null, fn, arity, ...rest]);\n}\n\nWith it you can transform your existing functions or create new ones that support currying from the start.\nconst curried_filter = curry(filter);\n\nconst exclude_falsey = curried_filter(Boolean);\n\nexclude_falsey([true, '', null, 'that']);\n\nOr.\nconst filter = curry(function(func, data) {\n  return data.filter(func); \n});\n\nThat's it folks. Hope you had a good time reading.\nSources\n\nHey Underscore, You're Doing It Wrong!

Functors is one of those term that you hear every now and then when people talk about functional programming but when the time comes to explain it they either bombard you with more abstract terms or tell you just the details you need to know. Since I have no knowledge of category theory I'm not going to pretend that I know exactly what a functor is, I'm just going show enough for you to know how you can spot them in the wild and how you can use them to your advantage.\nWhat is a functor?\nI'm convinced that the term is dificult to understand because one, you need to some other terms in order to get the whole picture and two, the theory behind it doesn't really translate very well in code. Let's start with the abstract.\nYou can think of them as a relation that exist between two sets of values. Bear with me, this will make sense in a second. Say we have two arrays.\nconst favorite_numbers  = [42, 69, 73];\nconst increased_numbers = [43, 70, 74];\n\nNice, we have a set favorite_numbers and a set increased_numbers, they are two separate arrays in diferent variables but we all know that there is a connection between those two, but more importantly we can express that connection with code. Imagine that the array increased_numbers doesn't exist but we still need those numbers, to make them appear again all we need is our good old friend map.\nconst increased_numbers = favorite_numbers.map(num =&gt; num + 1);\n\nmap will go through every number, increase it and put it in a new array which brings increased_numbers back into existence. Even though increased_numbers is something we made, we didn't create it out nowhere, we didn't magically invent 43, 70 and 74. All we did was describe a relation between those numbers and our favorite_numbers.\nIs that the whole history? Are functors just arrays? The answer to that is a big no. Arrays are just a freakishly convenient way to ilustrate a common use of functors. This leaves a question in the air.\nHow do you recognize them?\nI often hear other people describing functors as boxes. I for one don't think they're wrong because using a container data structure is one of easiest ways to implement a functor. The box analogy is specially funny 'cause in javascript we use brackets to create arrays, so you can actually create a functor by putting a value in a box. See.\n// A value\n1;\n\n// A box\n[];\n\n// Look, a value in a box.\n[1];\n\n// I regret nothing.\n\nGoing back to the original question, how do we recognize them? Okay, so it turns out that there are rules.\nDa rules\nAgain I'll be using array of numbers just because is convenient but this rules must apply to any structure that wants to be in the functor club.\nIdentity\nGiven the identity function.\nfunction identity(x) {\n  return x;\n}\n\nvalue and value.map(identity) must be equivalent.\nFor example.\n[1,2,3];               // =&gt; [1,2,3]\n[1,2,3].map(identity); // =&gt; [1,2,3]\n\nWhy is this important? What does this tell us?\nValid questions. This tells us that the map function must preserve the shape of the data structure. In our example, if we map an array of three elements we must recieve a new array of three elements. If we had an array of a hundred elements, using .map(identity) should return an array of a hundred elements. You get the point.\nComposition\nGiven two functions fx and gx the following must be true.\nvalue.map(fx).map(gx) and value.map(arg =&gt; gx(fx(arg))) must be equivalent.\nExample time.\nfunction add_one(num) {\n  return num + 1;\n}\n\nfunction times_two(num) {\n  return num * 2;\n}\n\n[1].map(add_one).map(times_two);         // =&gt; [4]\n[1].map(num =&gt; times_two(add_one(num))); // =&gt; [4]\n\nIf you know how Array.map works this feels like 'well duh!'. This actually gives you chance to optimize your code for readability or performance. In the case of arrays, multiple calls to map can have a big impact on performance when the number of elements in the list grows.\nAnd that's it. Those two rules are all you need to know to spot a functor.\nDoes it always has to be .map?\nI guess by now you wish to know what other things out there follow those rules that I just mentioned, if not I'll tell you anyway. There is another popular structure that also follows the rules and that is Promise. Let's see.\n// A value\n1;\n\n// A box\nPromise.resolve;\n\n// Look, a value in a box\nPromise.resolve(1);\n\n// Identity rule\nPromise.resolve(1).then(identity); // =&gt; 1 (in the future)\n\n// Composition\nPromise.resolve(1).then(add_one).then(times_two);        // =&gt; 4\nPromise.resolve(1).then(num =&gt; times_two(add_one(num))); // =&gt; 4\n\nTo be fair, Promise.then behaves more like Array.flatMap than Array.map but we will ignore that.\nFine, we have Array and we have Promise both are containers of some sort and both have methods that follow the rules. But what if they didn't have those methods, what if Array.map didn't exists? Would that mean that Array is no longer a functor? Do we lose all the benefits?\nLet's take a step back. If Array.map doesn't exists then Array is no longer a functor? I don't know, I'm not an FP lawyer. Do we lose all the benefits? No, we could still treat arrays as functors, we just lose the super convenient .map syntax. We can create our own map outside of the structure.\nconst List = {\n  map(fn, arr) {\n    let result = [];\n    for (let data of arr) {\n      result.push(fn(data));\n    }\n\n    return result;\n  }\n};\n\nSee? Is not that bad. And it works.\n// Identity rule\nList.map(identity, [1]); // =&gt; [1]\n\n// Composition\nList.map(times_two, List.map(add_one, [1]));   // =&gt; [4]\nList.map(num =&gt; times_two(add_one(num)), [1]); // =&gt; [4]\n\nAre you thinking what I'm thinking? Probably not. This is what I'm thinking, if we can map arrays without a .map then nothing can stop us from doing the same thing with plain objects, because after all, objects can also hold sets of values.\nconst Obj = {\n  map(fn, ob) {\n    let result = {};\n    for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(ob)) {\n      result[key] = fn(value);\n    }\n\n    return result;\n  }\n};\n\n// Why stop at `map`? \n// Based on this you can also create a `filter` and `reduce`\n\nLet's see it.\n// Identity rule\nObj.map(identity, {some: 1, prop: 2}); // =&gt; {some: 1, prop: 2}\n\n// Composition\nObj.map(times_two, Obj.map(add_one, {some: 1, prop: 2})); // =&gt; {some: 4, prop: 6}\nObj.map(num =&gt; times_two(add_one(num)), {some: 1, prop: 2}); // =&gt; {some: 4, prop: 6}\nDo It Yourself\nAll this talk about arrays and plain objects is useful but now I feel like we know enough to make our own functor, the rules seem to be very simple. Let's do something vaguely useful. Have you ever heard of Observables? Good, because we are going to something like that. We'll make a simpler version of mithril-stream, it'll be fun.\nThe goal here to handle a stream of values over time. The API of our utility will be this.\n// Set initial state\nconst num_stream = Stream(0);\n\n// Create a dependent stream\nconst increased = num_stream.map(add_one);\n\n// Get the value from a stream\nnum_stream(); // =&gt; 0\n\n// Push a value to the stream\nnum_stream(42); // =&gt; 42\n\n// The source stream updates\nnum_stream(); // =&gt; 42\n\n// The dependent stream also updates\nincreased(); // =&gt; 43\n\nLet's start with the getter and setter function.\nfunction Stream(state) {\n  let stream = function(value) {\n    // If we get an argument we update the state\n    if(arguments.length &gt; 0) {\n      state = value;\n    }\n\n    // return current state\n    return state;\n  }\n\n  return stream;\n}\n\nThis should work.\n// Initial state\nconst num_stream = Stream(42);\n\n// Get state\nnum_stream(); // =&gt; 42\n\n// Update\nnum_stream(73);\n\n// Check\nnum_stream(); // =&gt; 73\n\nWe know we want a map method but what is the effect we want? We want the callback to listen to the changes of the source stream. Let's start with the listener part, we want to store an array of listeners and execute each one right after the state changes.\n  function Stream(state) {\n+   let listeners = [];\n+\n    let stream = function(value) {\n      if(arguments.length &gt; 0) {\n        state = value;\n+       listeners.forEach(fn =&gt; fn(value));\n      }\n\n      return state;\n    }\n\n    return stream;\n  }\n\nNow we go for the map method, but is not going to be just any method, we need to follow the rules:\n\n\nIdentity: When map is called it needs to preserve the shape of the structure. This means that we need to return a new stream.\n\n\nComposition: Calling map multiple times must be equivalent of composing the callbacks supplied to those maps.\n\n\nfunction Stream(state) {\n  let listeners = [];\n\n  let stream = function(value) {\n    if(arguments.length &gt; 0) {\n      state = value;\n      listeners.forEach(fn =&gt; fn(value));\n    }\n\n    return state;\n  }\n\n  stream.map = function(fn) {\n    // Create new instance with transformed state.\n    // This will execute the callback when calling `map`\n    // this might not be what you want if you use a \n    // function that has side effects. Just beware.\n    let target = Stream(fn(state));\n\n    // Transform the value and update stream\n    const listener = value =&gt; target(fn(value));\n\n    // Update the source listeners\n    listeners.push(listener);\n\n    return target;\n  }\n\n  return stream;\n}\n\nLet's test the rules. We begin with identity.\n// Streams are like a cascade\n// the first is the most important\n// this is the one that triggers all the listeners\nconst num_stream = Stream(0);\n\n// Create dependent stream\nconst identity_stream = num_stream.map(identity); \n\n// update the source\nnum_stream(42);\n\n// Check\nnum_stream();      // =&gt; 42\nidentity_stream(); // =&gt; 42\n\nNow let's check the composition rule.\n// Create source stream\nconst num_stream = Stream(0);\n\n// Create dependents\nconst map_stream = num_stream.map(add_one).map(times_two);\nconst composed_stream = num_stream.map(num =&gt; times_two(add_one(num)));\n\n// Update source\nnum_stream(1);\n\n// Check\nmap_stream();      // =&gt; 4\ncomposed_stream(); // =&gt; 4\n\nOur job is done. But is this any useful? Can you do something with it? Well yes, you could use it in event handlers to manipulate user input. Like this.\n\n  \n    See the Pen an fmap example by Heiker (@VonHeikemen) on CodePen.\n  \n\n\nMore examples\nI think by now you understand really well what functors do, but if you still want to see more examples you can check out this articles. \n\nHandling the absence of a value\nHandling side effects\n\nConclusion\nThe only question that remains is \"what is the benefit of using functors?\"\nI'll do my best here:\n\n\nThis pattern allows you to focus on one problem at time. The map function handles how you get the data and in the callback you can focus only on processing the data.\n\n\nReusability. This style of programming really encourage the creation of single purpose function that a lot of the times can become useful even across projects.\n\n\nExtensibility through composition. People have mixed feelings about this one, specially if we are talking about arrays. This is another thing that functors encourage, that is using chains of functions to implement a procedure.\n\n\nSources\n\nWhy is map called map?\nFantasy land\nStatic land\nfuncadelic.js\nHow to deal with dirty side effects in your pure functional JavaScript\nWhat’s more fantastic than fantasy land?

Maybe you have but you still don't get it. Well... I'm not here to tell you what they are, I won't try to sell them to you either, what I will do is show you an example of how would it be if you use them in your javascripts.\nWe'll do something fun, lets solve a fairly trivial problem in an innecessary complicated way. \nSuppose that we have a dictionary stored in a json file or a plain js object.\n{\n    \"accident\": [\"An unexpected, unfortunate mishap, failure or loss with the potential for harming human life, property or the environment.\", \"An event that happens suddenly or by chance without an apparent cause.\"], \n    \"accumulator\": [\"A rechargeable device for storing electrical energy in the form of chemical energy, consisting of one or more separate secondary cells.\\\\n(Source: CED)\"],\n    \"acid\": [\"A compound capable of transferring a hydrogen ion in solution.\", \"Being harsh or corrosive in tone.\", \"Having an acid, sharp or tangy taste.\", \"A powerful hallucinogenic drug manufactured from lysergic acid.\", \"Having a pH less than 7, or being sour, or having the strength to neutralize  alkalis, or turning a litmus paper red.\"],\n    \n     // ... moar words and meanings\n    \n    \"Paris\": [\"The capital and largest city of France.\"]\n  }\n\nWe want a form that lets a user search one of this words and then shows the meaning(s). This is simple, right? What could possibly go wrong?\nBecause everyone loves HTML we'll start with that.\n&lt;form id=\"search_form\"&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"search_input\"&gt;Search a word&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"search_input\" type=\"text\"&gt;\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=\"result\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIn the first version we will just try get one those values based on the user input.\n// main.js\n\n// magically retrieve the data from a file or whatever\nconst entries = data();\n\nfunction format(results) {\n  return results.join('&lt;br&gt;'); // I regret nothing\n}\n\nwindow.search_form.addEventListener('submit', function(ev) {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  let input = ev.target[0];\n  window.result.innerHTML = format(entries[input.value]);\n});\n\nNaturally the first thing we try to search is \"acid.\" And behold here are the results.\n\nA compound capable of transferring a hydrogen ion in solution.\nBeing harsh or corrosive in tone.\nHaving an acid, sharp or tangy taste.\nA powerful hallucinogenic drug manufactured from lysergic acid.\nHaving a pH less than 7, or being sour, or having the strength to neutralize alkalis, or turning a litmus paper red.\n\nNow we search for \"paris\", I'm sure it's there. What did we get? Nothing. Not exactly nothing, we got.\n\nTypeError: results is undefined\n\nWe also got an unpredictable submit button that sometime works and sometimes doesn't. So what do we want? What do we really, really want? Safety, objects that don't crash our application, we want reliable objects. \nWhat we will do is implement containers that let us describe the flow of execution without worrying about the value they hold. Sounds good, right? Let me show you what I mean with a little javascript. Try this.\nconst is_even = num =&gt; num % 2 === 0;\n\nconst odd_arr = [1,3,4,5].filter(is_even).map(val =&gt; val.toString());\nconst empty_arr = [].filter(is_even).map(val =&gt; val.toString());\n\nconsole.log({odd_arr, empty_arr});\n\nDid it throw an exception on the empty array? (if it did let me know). Isn't that nice? Doesn't it feel all warm and fuzzy knowing that the array methods would do the right thing even if there isn't anything to work with? That is what we want.\nYou might be wondering couldn't we just write a few if statements and be done with it? Well... yeah, but where is the fun in that? We all know that chaining functions is cool, and we are fans of functional programming, we do what every functional programming savvy does: hide things under a function.\nSo we are going to hide an if statement (or maybe a couple), if the value we evaluate is undefined-ish we return a wrapper that will know how to behave no matter what happens.\n// maybe.js\n// (I would like to apologise for the many `thing`s you'll see)\n\nfunction Maybe(the_thing) {\n  if(the_thing === null \n     || the_thing === undefined \n     || the_thing.is_nothing\n  ) {\n    return Nothing();\n  }\n\n  // I don't want nested Maybes\n  if(the_thing.is_just) {\n    return the_thing;\n  }\n\n  return Just(the_thing);\n}\n\nThis wrappers are not going to be your standard by the book Maybe you see in a proper functional programming language. We will cheat a little in the name of convinience and side effects. Also their methods will be named after the methods in the Option type you find in Rust (I like those names better). Here is where the magic happens.\n// maybe.js\n\n// I lied, there will be a lot of cheating and `fun`s.\n\nfunction Just(thing) {\n  return {\n    map: fun =&gt; Maybe(fun(thing)),\n    and_then: fun =&gt; fun(thing),\n    or_else: () =&gt; Maybe(thing),\n    tap: fun =&gt; (fun(thing), Maybe(thing)),\n    unwrap_or: () =&gt; thing,\n    \n    filter: predicate_fun =&gt; \n      predicate_fun(thing) \n        ? Maybe(thing) \n        : Nothing(),\n    \n    is_just: true,\n    is_nothing: false,\n    inspect: () =&gt; `Just(${thing})`,\n  };\n}\n\nfunction Nothing() {\n  return {\n    map: Nothing,\n    and_then: Nothing,\n    or_else: fun =&gt; fun(),\n    tap: Nothing,\n    unwrap_or: arg =&gt; arg,\n\n    filter: Nothing,\n\n    is_just: false,\n    is_nothing: true,\n    inspect: () =&gt; `Nothing`,\n  };\n}\n\nWhat is the purpose of these methods?\n\nmap: Applies the function fun to the_thing and wraps it again on a Maybe to keep the party going... I mean to keep the shape of the object, so you can keep chaining functions.\nand_then: This is mostly an escape hatch. Apply the function fun and let fate decide.\nor_else: It is the else to your map and and_then. The other path. The \"what if is not there?\"\ntap: These one is there just for the side effects. If you see it then it's probably affecting something outside of it's scope (or maybe is just the perfect place to put a console.log).\nfilter: It \"lets you go through\" if the predicate function returns something truthy.\nunwrap_or: This is how you get the_thing out. You'll want this when you're done chaining methods and you're ready to get back to the imperative world.\n\nLets go back to our form and see it in action. We'll make a function search that may o may not retrieve a match to the user's query. If it does we'll chain other functions that will be executed in a \"safe context.\"\n// main.js\n\nconst search = (data, input) =&gt; Maybe(data[input]);\n\nconst search_word = word =&gt; search(entries, word)\n  .map(format)\n  .unwrap_or('word not found');\n\nAnd now we replace our unholy old way with the new safe(r) function.\n window.search_form.addEventListener('submit', function(ev) {\n   ev.preventDefault();\n   let input = ev.target[0];\n-  window.result.innerHTML = format(entries[input.value]);\n+  window.result.innerHTML = search_word(input.value);\n });\n\nNow we test. Search for \"accident.\"\n\nAn unexpected, unfortunate mishap, failure or loss with the potential for harming human life, property or the environment.\nAn event that happens suddenly or by chance without an apparent cause.\n\nNow Paris. Search for \"paris.\"\n\nword not found\n\nIt didn't freeze the button, that's good. But I know Paris is there. If you check you'll see that is \"Paris.\" We'll just capitalize the user input so they don't have to. First we'll try to search the exact input, if that fails we'll try the capitalize way.\n// main.js\n\nfunction create_search(data, exact) {\n  return input =&gt; {\n    const word = exact ? input : capitalize(input);\n    return Maybe(data[word]);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction capitalize(str) {\n  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);\n}\n\nChange the search function.\n- const search = (data, input) =&gt; Maybe(data[input]);\n+ const search = create_search(entries, true);\n+ const search_name = create_search(entries, false);\n-\n- const search_word = word =&gt; search(entries, word)\n+ const search_word = word =&gt; search(word)\n+   .or_else(() =&gt; search_name(word))\n    .map(format)\n    .unwrap_or('word not found');\n\nVery nice. This what we got so far in main.js if you wanna see the whole picture.\n// main.js\n\nconst entries = data();\n\nfunction create_search(data, exact) {\n  return input =&gt; {\n    const word = exact ? input : capitalize(input);\n    return Maybe(data[word]);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction capitalize(str) {\n  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);\n}\n\nfunction format(results) {\n  return results.join('&lt;br&gt;');\n}\n\nconst search = create_search(entries, true);\nconst search_name = create_search(entries, false);\n\nconst search_word = word =&gt; search(word)\n  .or_else(() =&gt; search_name(word))\n  .map(format)\n  .unwrap_or('word not found');\n\nwindow.search_form.addEventListener('submit', function(ev) {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  let input = ev.target[0];\n  window.result.innerHTML = search_word(input.value);\n});\n\nBut is that all we want in life? No, of course not, we want love but since javascript can't give us that we'll settle for a little \"suggest word\" feature. I want to search \"accu\" and have a confirm dialog telling me \"Did you mean accumulator?\"\nWe'll need help with this one, we'll bring a dependency, one that can perform a fuzzy search on the entries: fuzzy-search. So we add the following. \n// main.js\n\nimport FuzzySearch from 'https://unpkg.com/fuzzy-search@3.0.1/src/FuzzySearch.js';\n\nconst fzf = new FuzzySearch(\n  Object.keys(entries),\n  [],\n  {caseSensitive: false, sort: true}\n);\n\nBut again we can't perform a safe operation 'cause the moment we try to get a match from an empty array the whole thing will fall apart. So what do we do? We hide things under a function.\n// main.js\n\nfunction suggest(word) {\n  const matches = fzf.search(word);\n  return Maybe(matches[0]);\n}\n\nFuzzy search is ready, now lets throw in a super awesome confirm dialog. You'll love it.\n// main.js\n\nfunction confirm_word(value) {\n  if(value &amp;&amp; confirm(`Did you mean ${value}`)) {\n    return value;\n  }\n}\n\nWe combine the new functions with our search.\n// main.js\n\nconst suggest_word = value =&gt; () =&gt; suggest(value)\n  .map(confirm_word)\n  .map(search);\n\nAdd the feature to search_word.\n const search_word = word =&gt; search(word)\n   .or_else(() =&gt; search_name(word))\n+  .or_else(suggest_word(word))\n   .map(format)\n   .unwrap_or('word not found');\n\nThat works! But lets say we are allergic to if statements and not to mention that it's just rude to return undefined from a function. We can do better.\n function confirm_word(value) {\n-  if(value &amp;&amp; confirm(`Did you mean ${value}`)) {\n-    return value;\n-  }\n+  return confirm(`Did you mean ${value}`);\n }\n const suggest_word = value =&gt; () =&gt; suggest(value)\n-  .map(confirm_word)\n+  .filter(confirm_word)\n   .map(search);\n\nSomething bugs me. I search \"accu\", the dialog pops in, I confirm the suggestion and the results appears. But \"accu\" it's still there in the input, it's awkard. Lets update the input with the right word.\nconst update_input = val =&gt; window.search_form[0].value = val;\n const suggest_word = value =&gt; () =&gt; suggest(value)\n   .filter(confirm_word)\n+  .tap(update_input)\n   .map(search);\n\nWant to see it in action? There you go.\n\n  \n    See the Pen Maybe I got your word by Heiker (@VonHeikemen) on CodePen.\n  \n\n\nBonus track\n\nWarning: The main point of the post (which is me showing that codepen example) was already accomplished. What follows is a strange experiment to see if I could make that Maybe function support asynchronous operations. If you are tired just skip everything and check out the last example code.\n\nNow you might be saying: this is cute and all but in the \"real world\" we make http requests, query a database, make all sorts of asynchronous stuff, can this still be useful in that context?\nI hear you. Our current implementation just supports normal blocking tasks. You would have to break the chain of Maybes the moment a Promise shows up. \nBut what if... listen... we make a promise aware Just. We can do that, an AsyncJust? JustAsync? Oh, that's awful.\nIf you don't know, a Promise is a data type that javascript uses to coordinate future events. To do so it uses a method called then that takes a callback (it also has catch for when things go wrong) So if we hijack what goes into that then then we can keep our nice Maybe interface.\nHow good are you following a bunch of callbacks?\nHere I go. Let me show you the Future.\n// Don't judge me. \n\nfunction Future(promise_thing) { \n  return {\n    map: fun =&gt; Future(promise_thing.then(map_future(fun))),\n    and_then: fun =&gt; Future(promise_thing.then(map_future(fun))),\n    or_else: fun =&gt; Future(promise_thing.catch(fun)),\n    tap: fun =&gt; Future(promise_thing.then(val =&gt; (fun(val), val))),\n    unwrap_or: arg =&gt; promise_thing.catch(val =&gt; arg),\n\n    filter: fun =&gt; Future(promise_thing.then(filter_future(fun))), \n\n    is_just: false,\n    is_nothing: false,\n    is_future: true,\n    inspect: () =&gt; `&lt;Promise&gt;`\n  };\n}\n\nIf we remove the noise maybe we could understand better.\n// In it's very core is callbacks all the way.\n\n{\n  map: fun =&gt; promise.then(fun),\n  and_then: fun =&gt; promise.then(fun),\n  or_else: fun =&gt; promise.catch(fun),\n  tap: fun =&gt; promise.then(val =&gt; (fun(val), val))),\n  unwrap_or: arg =&gt; promise.catch(val =&gt; arg),\n\n  filter: fun =&gt; promise.then(fun), \n}\n\n\nmap/and_then: these do the same thing because you can't get out of a Promise. \nor_else: puts your callback in the catch method to mimic an else behavior.\ntap: uses then to peek at the value. Since this is for side effects we return the value again.\nunwrap_or: It will return the promise so you can use await. If everything goes well the original value of the Promise will be returned when you await, else the provided argument will be returned. Either way the promise doesn't throw an error because the Future attached the catch method to it.\nfilter: these one is a special kind of map that's why filter_future exists.\nAlmost all these methods return a new Future 'cause promise.then returns a new Promise.\n\nWhat makes the Future weird is what happens inside map. Remember map_future?\nfunction map_future(fun) { // `fun` is the user's callback\n  return val =&gt; {\n    /* Evaluate the original value */\n    let promise_content = val;\n\n    // It needs to decide if the value of the Promise\n    // can be trusted\n    if(Maybe(promise_content).is_nothing) {\n      Promise.reject();\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // If it is a Just then unwrap it.\n    if(promise_content.is_just) {\n      promise_content = val.unwrap_or();\n    }\n\n    /* Evaluate the return value of the user's callback */\n\n    // Use Maybe because I have trust issues.\n    // For the javascript world is undefined and full of errors.\n    const result = Maybe(fun(promise_content));\n\n    if(result.is_just) {\n      // If it gets here it's all good.\n      return result.unwrap_or();\n    }\n\n    // at this point i should check if result is a Future\n    // if that happens you are using them in a wrong way\n    // so for now I don't do it \n\n    // There is something seriously wrong.\n    return Promise.reject();\n  }\n}\n\nNow filter_future.\nfunction filter_future(predicate_fun) { // the user's function\n  return val =&gt; {\n    const result = predicate_fun(val);\n\n    // Did you just returned a `Promise`?\n    if(result.then) {\n      // You did! That's why you can't have nice things.\n \n      // peek inside the user's promise.\n      const return_result = the_real_result =&gt; the_real_result \n        ? val\n        : Promise.reject();\n\n      // keep the promise chain alive.\n      return result.then(return_result);\n    }\n\n    return result ? val : Promise.reject();\n  }\n}\n\nThere is one last thing I would like to do and that is create a helper function to convert a regular value into a Future.\nFuture.from_val = function(val) {\n  return Future(Promise.resolve(val));\n}\n\nAll we have to do now to support a Future in a Maybe is this.\n function Maybe(the_thing) {\n   if(the_thing === null \n     || the_thing === undefined \n     || the_thing.is_nothing\n   ) {\n     return Nothing();\n   }\n-\n-  if(the_thing.is_just) {\n+  if(the_thing.is_future || the_thing.is_just) {\n     return the_thing;\n    }\n\n    return Just(the_thing);\n }\n\nBut the million dollar question remains. Does it actually work?\nI have CLI version of this. And here is the same codepen example with some tweaks: I added the Future related functions, the confirm dialog is actually a dialog (this one) and the event listener is now an async function that can await the result.\n\n  \n    See the Pen Maybe I will promise you a word by Heiker (@VonHeikemen) on CodePen.\n  \n\nBonus bonus edit\nThat is how it looks like when we cheat. If we didn't cheat it would be like this.\nOther resources\n\nOption/Maybe, Either, and Future Monads in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, and Scala\nThe Marvellously Mysterious JavaScript Maybe Monad\nMonad Mini-Series: Functors (video)\nOh Composable World!

I hope that by the end of this post we gain a better understanding of this pattern that is used in libraries like RxJS.\nAbout Observables\nWhat is it?\nLets start with my definition of observable.\n\nAn Observable is a function that follows a convention and is used to connect a data source with a consumer.\n\nIn our case a data source is something that produces values. And, a consumer is something that receives values from a data source.\nFun facts\nObservables are lazy\nThat means that they would not do any kind of work until it's absolutly necessary. Nothing will happen until you subscribe to them.\nThey can emit multiple values\nDepending on the data source you can receive a finite number of values or an infinite stream of values.\nThey can be synchronous or asynchronous\nIt all depends on their internal implementation. You can setup an observable that process some stream of data in a synchronous way or create one from an event that can happen over time.\nSome rules\nRemember when I said that observables follow a convention? Well, we are going to make our own arbitrary rules that our implementation will follow. This are important because we are going to build a little ecosystem around our observables.\nHere we go:\n\nAn observable instance will have a subscribe method.\nThe observable \"factory\" will take a subscriber function as a parameter.\nThe subscriber function will take an observer object as a parameter.\nThe observer object can implement these methods next, error and complete.\n\nNow, lets do stuff.\nThe code\nFactory function\nfunction Observable(subscriber) {\n  return {\n    subscribe: observer =&gt; subscriber(observer)\n  };\n}\n\n// I swear to you, this works.\n\nThat is less magical than I thought. What we see here is that the Observable factory is just a way to postpone the work that has to be done until you call subscribe. The subscriber function is doing the heavy lifting, that's good because we can do whatever we want in there, is what will make our observables useful.\nSo far I haven't done a really good job explaining the observer and the subscriber roles. I hope it'll become clear when you see them in action.\nA use case\nSay that we want to convert an array into an Observable. How can we do this?\nLets think about what we know: \n\nWe can do all of our logic inside the subscriber function.\nWe can expect an observer object with three methods, next, error and complete\n\nWe can use the methods of the observer object as communication channels. The next function will receive the values that our data source gives us. The error will handle any errors we throw at it, it will be like the catch function in the Promise class. And, we will use the complete method when the data source is done producing values.\nOur array to observable function could look like this.\nfunction fromArray(arr) {\n  return Observable(function(observer) {\n    try {\n      arr.forEach(value =&gt; observer.next(value));\n      observer.complete();\n    } catch (e) {\n      observer.error(e);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n// This is how we use it\n\nvar arrayStream = fromArray([1, 2, 3, 4]);\n\narrayStream.subscribe({\n  next: value =&gt; console.log(value),\n  error: err =&gt; console.error(err),\n  complete: () =&gt; console.info('Nothing more to give')\n});\n\n// And now watch all the action on the console\nBe safe\nRight now the observer object is basically a lawless town, we could do all sorts of weird stuff like sending yet another value to next even after we call the complete method. Ideally our observables should give us some guarantees, like:\n\nThe methods on the observer object should be optional.\nThe complete and error methods need to call the unsubscribe function (if there is one).\nIf you unsubscribe, you can't call next, complete or error.\nIf the complete or error method were called, no more values are emitted. \n\nInteractive example\nWe can actually start doing some interesting things with what we learned so far. In this example I made a helper function that let me create an observable from a DOM event.\n\n  \n    See the Pen Observables - basics by Heiker (@VonHeikemen) on CodePen.\n  \n\n\nNow we will learn how we can manipulate existing Observables to extend their behavior.\nIt all starts with operators\nThis time we'll create some utility functions, and tweak a little bit our current Observable implementation, in order to create more flexible features with them.\nOperators are functions that allow us to extend the behavior of an observable with a chain of functions. Each of this functions can take an observable as a data source and returns a new observable.\nLets keep the array theme in here and create a map operator that emulates the native map function of the Array prototype, but for observables. Our operator will do this: take a value, apply to the value a function that will perform some transformation and return a new value.\nLets give a try:\nFirst step, get the transform function and the data source, then return a new observable that we can use.\nfunction map(transformFn, source$) {\n  return Observable(function(observer) {\n    // to be continued...\n  });\n}\n\nHere comes the cool part, the source that we get is an observable and that means we can subscribe to it to get some values.\nfunction map(transformFn, source$) {\n  return Observable(function(observer) {\n    // remember to keep returning values from your functions.\n    // This will return the unsubcribe function\n    return source$.subscribe(function(value) {\n      // to be continued...\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nNow we need to pass the result of the transformation to the observer so we can \"see\" it when we subscribe to this new observable.\nfunction map(transformFn, source$) {\n  return Observable(function(observer) {\n    return source$.subscribe(function(value) {\n      // ****** WE ARE HERE ******\n      var newValue = transformFn(value);\n      observer.next(newValue);\n      // *************************\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nThere is a lot of indentation and returns going on in here. We can \"fix\" that if we use arrow functions all the way.\nfunction map(transformFn, source$) {\n  return Observable(observer =&gt; \n    source$.subscribe(value =&gt; observer.next(\n      transformFn(value)\n    ))\n  );\n}\n\n// that didn't do much for the indentation. \n// Well, you can't win them all.\n\nWe still need to use the operator and right now this will be it.\nfunction fromArray(arr) {\n  return Observable(function(observer) {\n    arr.forEach(value =&gt; observer.next(value));\n    observer.complete();\n  });\n}\n\nvar thisArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nvar plusOne   = num =&gt; num + 1;\nvar array$    = map(plusOne, fromArray(thisArray));\n\narray$.subscribe(value =&gt; console.log(value));\n\nThis doesn't feel very chainy. In order to use more of this map functions we would have to nest them, and that ain't right. Don't worry, we'll get to that in a moment.\nPipe all the things\nWe will create a helper function that will allow us to use one or more operators that can modify an observable source. \nThis function will take a collection of functions, and each function in the collection will use the return value of the previous function as an input.\nFirst, I'm going to show how this could be done as a standalone helper function.\nfunction pipe(aFunctionArray, initialSource) {\n  var reducerFn = function(source, fn) {\n    var result = fn(source);\n    return result;\n  };\n\n  var finalResult = aFunctionArray.reduce(reducerFn, initialSource);\n\n  return finalResult;\n}\n\nIn here the reduce function loops over the array and for each element in it executes reducerFn. Inside reducerFn in the first loop, source will be initialSource and in the rest of the loops source will be whatever you return from reducerFn. The finalResult is just the last result returned from reducerFn.\nWith some modifications (ES6+ goodness included) we can use this helper function within our Observable factory to make it more flexible. Our new factory would now look like this:\nfunction Observable (subscriber) {\n  var observable = {\n    subscribe: observer =&gt; subscriber(SafeObserver(observer)),\n    pipe: function (...fns) {\n      return fns.reduce((source, fn) =&gt; fn(source), observable);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return observable; \n}\n\nOne last thing that we need to do is make sure our operators are compatible with this new pipe function. For example, our current map operator expects both transformFn and source at the same time. That just won't happen inside pipe. Will have to split it into two functions, one that will take the initial necesary parameters to make it work and another one that takes the source observable.\nThere are a couple of ways we can do this.\n// Option 1\nfunction map(transformFn) {\n  // Instead of returning an observable \n  // we return a function that expects a source\n  return source$ =&gt; Observable(observer =&gt; \n    source$.subscribe(value =&gt; observer.next(\n      transformFn(value)\n    ))\n  );\n}\n\n// Option 2\nfunction map(transformFn, source$) {\n  if(source$ === undefined) {\n    // we'll return a function \n    // that will \"remember\" the transform function\n    // and expect the source and put in its place.\n    \n    return placeholder =&gt; map(transformFn, placeholder);\n  }\n\n  return Observable(observer =&gt; \n    source$.subscribe(value =&gt; observer.next(\n      transformFn(value)\n    ))\n  );\n}\n\nAnd finally we can extend our observable in this way:\nvar thisArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nvar plusOne   = num =&gt; num + 1;\nvar timesTwo  = num =&gt; num * 2;\n\nvar array$ = fromArray(thisArray).pipe(\n  map(plusOne),\n  map(timesTwo),\n  map(num =&gt; `number: ${num}`),\n  // ... many more operators\n);\n\narray$.subscribe(value =&gt; console.log(value));\n\nNow we are ready to create more operators.\nExercise time\nLets say that we have a piece of code that prints a \"time string\" to the console every second, and stops after five seconds (because why not). This guy right here:\nfunction startTimer() {\n  var time = 0;\n  var interval = setInterval(function() {\n    time = time + 1;\n\n    var minutes = Math.floor((time / 60) % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');\n    var seconds = Math.floor(time % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');\n    var timeString = minutes + ':' + seconds;\n\n    console.log(timeString);\n\n    if(timeString === '00:05') {\n      clearInterval(interval);\n    }\n  }, 1000);\n}\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this piece of code. I mean, it does the job, it's predictable, and everything you need to know about it is there in plain sight. But you know, we are in a refactoring mood and we just learned something new. We'll turn this into an observable thingy.\nFirst things first, lets make a couple of helper function that handle the formatting and time calculations.\nfunction paddedNumber(num) {\n  return num.toString().padStart(2, '0');\n}\n\nfunction readableTime(time) {\n  var minutes = Math.floor((time / 60) % 60);\n  var seconds = Math.floor(time % 60);\n \n  return paddedNumber(minutes) + ':' + paddedNumber(seconds);\n}\n\nNow lets handle the time. setInterval is a great candidate for a data source, it takes a callback in which we could produce values, it also has a \"cleanup\" mechanism. It just makes the perfect observable.\nfunction interval(delay) {\n  return Observable(function(observer) {\n    var counter   = 0;\n    var callback  = () =&gt; observer.next(counter++);\n    var _interval = setInterval(callback, delay);\n    \n    observer.setUnsubscribe(() =&gt; clearInterval(_interval));\n    \n    return observer.unsubscribe;\n  });\n}\n\nThis is amazing, we now have really reusable way to set and destroy an interval.\nYou may have notice that we are passing a number to the observer, we are not calling it seconds because the delay can be any arbitrary number. In here we're not keeping track of the time, we are merely counting how many times the callback has been executed. Why? Because we want to make every observable factory as generic as posible. We can always modify the value that it emits by using operators.\nThis how we could use our new interval function.\n// pretend we have our helper functions in scope.\n\nvar time$ = interval(1000).pipe(\n  map(plusOne),\n  map(readableTime)\n);\n\nvar unsubscribe = time$.subscribe(function(timeString) {\n  console.log(timeString);\n  \n  if(timeString === '00:05') {\n    unsubscribe();\n  }\n});\n\nThats better. But that if bothers me. I feel like that behavior doesn't belong in there. You know what? I'll make an operator that can unsubcribe to the interval after it emits five values.\n// I'll named \"take\" because naming is hard.\n// Also, that is how is called in other libraries.\n\nfunction take(total) {\n  return source$ =&gt; Observable(function(observer) {\n    // we'll have our own counter because I don't trust in the values\n    // that other observables emits\n    var count = 0;\n    var unsubscribeSource = source$.subscribe(function(value) {\n      count++;\n      // we pass every single value to the observer.\n      // the subscribe function will still get every value in the stream \n      observer.next(value);\n      \n      if (count === total) {\n        // we signal the completion of the stream and \"destroy\" the thing\n        observer.complete();\n        unsubscribeSource();\n      }\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nNow we can have a self destructing timer. Finally.\n// pretend we have our helper functions in scope.\n\nvar time$ = interval(1000).pipe(\n  map(plusOne),\n  map(readableTime),\n  take(5)\n);\n\ntime$.subscribe({\n  next: timeString =&gt; console.log(timeString),\n  complete: () =&gt; console.info(\"Time's up\")\n});\nPlaygrounds\nI made a couple of pens so you can play around with this stuff. This pen contains all the Observable related code that I wrote for this posts and them some more.\nAnd this is the pen for the exercise.\n\n  \n    See the Pen Observables - boring timer by Heiker (@VonHeikemen) on CodePen.\n  \n\nConclusion\nObservables are a powerful thing, with a little bit of creativity you can turn anything you want into an observable. Really. A promise, an AJAX request, a DOM event, an array, a time interval and anything you can imagine can be a source of data that can be wrapped in an observable.\nThey are a powerful abstraction. They can let you processs streams of data one chunk at a time. Not only that, but also let you piece together solutions that can be compose by generic functions and custom functions specific to the problem at hand. \nFair warning though. They are not the ultimate solution to every problem. You'll have to decide if the complexity of it is worth it. Like in the exercise, we lose the simplicity of the startTimer in order to gain some flexibility (that we could've achieve some other way).\nSources\n\nLearning Observable By Building Observable\nObservables, just powerful functions?\nWho’s Afraid of Observables?\nUnderstanding mergeMap and switchMap in RxJS\nJavaScript — Observables Under The Hood\nGithub repository - zen-observable\nUnderstanding Observables\n\nThank you for reading.\n","id":"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/homemade-observables/","title":"Homemade observables"},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/lenses-a-k-a-composable-getters-and-setters/":{"body":"This time around we will figure out what are lenses, how do they look like in javascript and hopefully will build a mostly adequate implementation.\nLet us first take a step back and ask.\nWhat are getters and setters?\nThis are functions that have one goal, they get or set value. But of course that is not the only thing they are good for. Most use cases I've seen involve triggering a side-effect when a value changes or put some validations to prevent some undesired behavior.\nIn javascript you could make them explicit by doing something like this.\nfunction Some() {\n  let thing = 'stuff';\n\n  return {\n    get_thing() {\n      // you can do anything in here\n      return thing;\n    },\n    set_thing(value) {\n      // same in here.\n      thing = value;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet obj = Some();\nobj.get_thing(); // =&gt; 'stuff'\n\nobj.set_thing('other stuff');\n\nobj.get_thing(); // =&gt; 'other stuff'\n\nOr you could make then implicit.\nlet some = {};\n\nObject.defineProperty(some, 'thing', {\n  get() {\n    return 'thing';\n  },\n  set(value) {\n    console.log(\"can't touch this\");\n  }\n});\n\nsome.thing // =&gt; 'thing'\nsome.thing = 'what?';\n\n//\n// can't touch this\n//\n\nsome.thing // =&gt; 'thing'\n\nBut what is so wrong in there that some people feel the need to use something like lenses?\nLet's start with that second example. I can tell you that some people don't like magical things, just the thought of a function being executed without their knowledge is bad enough.\nThe first example is bit more interesting. Let's see it again.\nobj.get_thing(); // =&gt; 'stuff'\n\nobj.set_thing('other stuff');\n\nobj.get_thing(); // =&gt; 'other stuff'\n\nYou use get_thing you get stuff, so far so good. But here is the problem you use it again in exactly the same way and yet you get other stuff. You kinda have to keep track of the last call to set_thing in order to know what you would get. We don't have the ability to predict the result from get_thing, you can't be 100% sure what it will do without looking around (or knowing) others parts of the code.\nIs there a better way?\nI wouldn't say better. Let us just try lenses, you can decide later if you like them or not.\nWhat do we need? Lenses are a functional programing thing so the first thing we will do is create helper functions. This will be the first version of getters and setters.\n// Getter\nfunction prop(key) {\n  return obj =&gt; obj[key];\n}\n\n// Setter\nfunction assoc(key) {\n  return (val, obj) =&gt; Object.assign({}, obj, {[key]: val});\n}\n\nNow for the \"constructor.\"\nfunction Lens(getter, setter) {\n  return { getter, setter };\n}\n\n// That is it.\n\nYou'll notice that Lens does absolutly nothing, I'm doing that on purpose. You can already tell that most of the work is in the getter and setter. Your lens are going to be as robust as your getter and setter implementations.\nNow we need to make them do something we will make three little functions. \nview: gets a value\nfunction view(lens, obj) {\n   return lens.getter(obj);\n}\n\nover: transforms a value using a callback\nfunction over(lens, fn, obj) {\n  return lens.setter(\n    fn(lens.getter(obj)),\n    obj\n  );\n}\n\nset: replaces a value\nfunction always(val) {\n  return () =&gt; val;\n}\n\nfunction set(lens, val, obj) {\n  // don't you love reusability?\n  return over(lens, always(val), obj);\n}\n\nIt's time for a test drive.\nLet's say we have an object named alice.\nconst alice = {\n  name: 'Alice Jones',\n  address: ['22 Walnut St', 'San Francisco', 'CA'],\n  pets: { dog: 'joker', cat: 'batman' }\n};\n\nWe'll start with something simple, inspect the values. This is how you would do it.\nconst result = view(\n  Lens(prop('name'), assoc('name')),\n  alice\n);\n\nresult // =&gt; \"Alice Jones\"\n\nI see you're not impressed and that's fine. I just wrote a lot characters just to get a name. But here is the thing, these are standalone functions. We can always compose and create new ones. Let's start with that Lens(prop, assoc) bit, we will put that in a function because we will use it a lot.\nfunction Lprop(key) {\n  return Lens(prop(key), assoc(key));\n}\n\nAnd now...\nconst result = view(Lprop('name'), alice);\n\nresult // =&gt; \"Alice Jones\"\n\nYou could even take it one step further and make a function that just expects the object that holds the data.\nconst get_name = obj =&gt; view(Lprop('name'), obj);\n\n// or with partial application\n\nconst get_name = view.bind(null, Lprop('name'));\n\n// or using a curry utility.\n// view = curry(view);\n\nconst get_name = view(Lprop('name'));\n\n// and you can also do this with `set` and `over`\n\nEnough of that. Going back to our test, let's try over. Let's transform the name to uppercase.\nconst upper = str =&gt; str.toUpperCase();\nconst uppercase_alice = over(Lprop('name'), upper, alice);\n\n// see?\nget_name(uppercase_alice) // =&gt; \"ALICE JONES\"\n\n// sanity check\nget_name(alice)           // =&gt; \"Alice Jones\"\n\nIt's set's turn.\nconst alice_smith = set(Lprop('name'), 'Alice smith', alice);\n\nget_name(alice_smith) // =&gt; \"Alice smith\"\n\n// sanity check\nget_name(alice)       // =&gt; \"Alice Jones\"\n\nThat's all nice but the name is just one property, what about nested object keys or arrays? Ah, you see now that is where it gets awkard with our current implementation. Right now you could do the following.\nlet dog = Lens(\n  obj =&gt; prop('dog')(prop('pets')(obj)),\n  obj =&gt; assoc('dog')(assoc('pets')(obj))\n);\n\nview(dog, alice); // =&gt; \"joker\"\n\n// or bring a `compose` utility\n\ndog = Lens(\n  compose(prop(\"dog\"), prop(\"pets\")),\n  compose(assoc(\"dog\"), assoc(\"pets\"))\n);\n\nview(dog, alice); // =&gt; \"joker\"\n\nI hear you. Don't worry, I wouldn't let you write stuff like that. It is because of situations like this one that people say stuff like \"just use Ramda\" (and those people are right) But what makes ramda so special?\nMaking it special\nIf you go to ramda's documentation and search \"lens\" you'll see that they have a lensProp function which is basically our Lprop. And if you go to the source you'll see something like this.\nfunction lensProp(k) {\n  return lens(prop(k), assoc(k));\n}\n\nLook at that. But now the comments on their source and documentation suggest that it also works with just one property. Let's go back to our \"lens\" search on their site. Now we will check that curious lensPath function. It is exactly what we want. Once again we check out the source.\nfunction lensPath(p) {\n  return lens(path(p), assocPath(p));\n}\n\n// Welcome to functional programming, y'all.\n\nThe secret sauce it's made of other functions that don't have any specific ties to lenses. Isn't that just nice?\nWhat is in that path function? Let's check it out. I'll show you a slightly different version, but it works just the same.\nfunction path(keys, obj) {\n  if (arguments.length === 1) {\n    // this is for currying\n    // they do this by wrapping `path`\n    // with a helper function\n    // but this is what happens\n    // they return a function that remembers `keys`\n    // and expects `obj`\n    return path.bind(this, keys);\n  }\n\n  var result = obj;\n  var idx = 0;\n  while (idx &lt; keys.length) {\n    // we don't like null\n    if (result == null) {\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    // this is how we get the nested keys\n    result = result[keys[idx]];\n    idx += 1;\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n\nI'll do the same with assocPath. For this one they make use of some internal helpers but again this is what happens.\nfunction assocPath(path, value, obj) {\n  // again with the currying stuff\n  // this is why they have a helper function\n  if (arguments.length === 1) {\n    return assocPath.bind(this, path);\n  } else if (arguments.length === 2) {\n    return assocPath.bind(this, path, value);\n  }\n\n  // check for an empty list\n  if (path.length === 0) {\n    return value;\n  }\n\n  var index = path[0];\n\n  // Beware: recursion ahead.\n  if (path.length &gt; 1) {\n    var is_empty =\n      typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null || !obj.hasOwnProperty(index);\n\n    // if the current object is \"empty\"\n    // we need to create a new one\n    // otherwise we pick the object at `index`\n    var next = is_empty\n      ? typeof path[1] === 'number'\n        ? []\n        : {}\n      : obj[index];\n\n    // we start again the process\n    // but now with a reduced `path`\n    // and `next` as the new `obj`\n    value = assocPath(Array.prototype.slice.call(path, 1), value, next);\n  }\n\n  // the base cases\n  // we either have to copy an array\n  // or an object\n  if (typeof index === 'number' &amp;&amp; Array.isArray(obj)) {\n    // make a 'copy' of the array\n    var arr = [].concat(obj);\n\n    arr[index] = value;\n    return arr;\n  } else {\n    // old school 'copy'\n    var result = {};\n    for (var p in obj) {\n      result[p] = obj[p];\n    }\n\n    result[index] = value;\n    return result;\n  }\n}\n\nWith our new found knowledge we can create an Lpath function and improve Lprop.\nfunction Lpath(keys) {\n  return Lens(path(keys), assocPath(keys));\n}\n\nfunction Lprop(key) {\n  return Lens(path([key]), assocPath([key]));\n}\n\nNow we can do more stuff, like playing with alice pets.\nconst dog_lens = Lpath(['pets', 'dog']);\n\nview(dog_lens, alice);     // =&gt; 'joker'\n\nlet new_alice = over(dog_lens, upper, alice);\nview(dog_lens, new_alice); // =&gt; 'JOKER'\n\nnew_alice = set(dog_lens, 'Joker', alice);\nview(dog_lens, new_alice); // =&gt; 'Joker'\n\nAll of this works great but there is just one tiny detail, the lenses that the current constructor creates aren't composable. Imagine that we have three lenses from diferents files or something and we want to combine them like this.\ncompose(pet_lens, imaginary_lens, dragon_lens);\n\nThis wouldn't work because compose expects a list of functions and our lenses are objects. But we can fix this (in a very funny way) with some functional programming trickery.\nLet's start with our lenses constructor. Instead of returning an object we are going to return a \"curried\" function that takes a callback, an object and returns a Functor (a thing that has map method and follows this rules)\nfunction Lens(getter, setter) {\n  return fn =&gt; obj =&gt; {\n    const apply = focus =&gt; setter(focus, obj);\n    const functor = fn(getter(obj));\n    return functor.map(apply);\n  };\n}\n\nWhat's with the a fn =&gt; obj =&gt; stuff? That is going to help us with our compose situation. Now after you provide the getter and setter you get a function, and that is what makes compose happy.\nAnd functor.map? That is going to make sure that we can still use a lens as unit (like Lprop('pets')) but also a part of a chain using compose.\nIn case you are wondering what the good folks at ramda do different, they use their own bulletproof implementation of map.\nNow we modify view and over. Starting with view.\nfunction view(lens, obj) {\n  const constant = value =&gt; ({ value, map: () =&gt; constant(value) });\n  return lens(constant)(obj).value;\n}\n\nThat constant thing might look like is too much, but it does the job. Things can get crazy in those compose chains, that just makes sure the value you want stays safe.\nWhat about over? It will do almost the same thing, except that in this case we do need to use the setter function.\nfunction over(lens, fn, obj) {\n  const identity = value =&gt; ({ value, map: setter =&gt; identity(setter(value)) });\n  const apply = val =&gt; identity(fn(val));\n  return lens(apply)(obj).value;\n}\n\nAnd now we should have a mostly adequate Lens implementation. The whole thing without dependencies (path and assocPath) should look like this.\nfunction Lens(getter, setter) {\n  return fn =&gt; obj =&gt; {\n    const apply = focus =&gt; setter(focus, obj);\n    const functor = fn(getter(obj));\n    return functor.map(apply);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction view(lens, obj) {\n  const constant = value =&gt; ({ value, map: () =&gt; constant(value) });\n  return lens(constant)(obj).value;\n}\n\nfunction over(lens, fn, obj) {\n  const identity = value =&gt; ({ value, map: setter =&gt; identity(setter(value)) });\n  const apply = val =&gt; identity(fn(val));\n  return lens(apply)(obj).value;\n}\n\nfunction set(lens, val, obj) {\n  return over(lens, always(val), obj);\n}\n\nfunction Lprop(key) {\n  return Lens(path([key]), assocPath([key]));\n}\n\nfunction Lpath(keys) {\n  return Lens(path(keys), assocPath(keys));\n}\n\nfunction always(val) {\n  return () =&gt; val;\n}\n\nBut can you believe me if I said it works? You shouldn't. Let's make some tests. We'll bring back alice and add her sister calie.\nconst alice = {\n  name: \"Alice Jones\",\n  address: [\"22 Walnut St\", \"San Francisco\", \"CA\"],\n  pets: { dog: \"joker\", cat: \"batman\", imaginary: { dragon: \"harley\" } }\n};\n\nconst calie = {\n  name: \"calie Jones\",\n  address: [\"22 Walnut St\", \"San Francisco\", \"CA\"],\n  pets: { dog: \"riddler\", cat: \"ivy\", imaginary: { dragon: \"hush\" } },\n  friend: [alice]\n};\n\nAnd because we planned ahead we have some lenses already available.\n// some generic lens\nconst head_lens = Lprop(0);\n\n// specific lens\nconst bff_lens = compose(Lprop('friend'), head_lens); \nconst imaginary_lens = Lpath(['pets', 'imaginary']);\n\nSay that we want to do something with their dragons, all we have to do is compose.\nconst dragon_lens = compose(imaginary_lens, Lprop('dragon'));\n\n// just for fun\nconst bff_dragon_lens = compose(bff_lens, dragon_lens); \n\n// demo\nconst upper = str =&gt; str.toUpperCase();\n\n// view\nview(dragon_lens, calie);         // =&gt; \"hush\"\nview(bff_dragon_lens, calie);     // =&gt; \"harley\"\n\n// over\nlet new_calie = over(dragon_lens, upper, calie);\nview(dragon_lens, new_calie);     // =&gt; \"HUSH\"\n\nnew_calie = over(bff_dragon_lens, upper, calie);\nview(bff_dragon_lens, new_calie); // =&gt; \"HARLEY\"\n\n// set\nnew_calie = set(dragon_lens, 'fluffykins', calie);\nview(dragon_lens, new_calie);     // =&gt; \"fluffykins\"\n\nnew_calie = set(bff_dragon_lens, 'pumpkin', calie);\nview(bff_dragon_lens, new_calie); // =&gt; \"pumpkin\"\n\nSo we just manipulated a deeply nested object property by composing lenses. If you're not excited then I don't know what to tell you. We just solve a problem by composing functions! \nThese things can be hard to sell because they require for you to write in a certain style in order to make the most out of it. And for people who write javascript there are libraries out there that solve the same problem in a more convenient way, or at least in a way that is more suitable for their style. \nAnyway, if you're still interested in seeing lenses in a non trivial context checkout this repository, it is a real world example app (kinda like medium.com clone) that uses hyperapp to handle the frontend. In it the author chose to use lenses to handle state of the app.\nSources\n\nramda - docs\nfp-lenses.js\nLambda World 2018 - Functional Lenses in JavaScript (video)\n\n","id":"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/lenses-a-k-a-composable-getters-and-setters/","title":"Lenses A.K.A. composable getters and setters"},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/taking-a-look-at-finite-state-machine/":{"body":"The finite who-- what?\nIt is a way of modeling the behavior of a system. The idea is that your \"system\" can only be in one state at any given time, and an input (or event) can trigger the transition to another state.\nWhat kind of problems does it solve?\nInvalid state. How many times have you used a flag or attribute like \"disabled\" to prevent a user from doing something they shouldn't do? By setting the rules of our system we can avoid these kind of problems.\nHow does that look like in javascript?\nI'm very glad you asked. The real reason I'm writing this is to show you a library that I saw the other day. We are going to use robot3 to built a random quote machine.\nWe will make a card that displays a quote and below that we'll have a button that will fetch another quote.\nWe'll do it one step at a time. Let's first prepare the states. \nOur card will be either idle or loading. Create a machine with that.\nimport {\n  createMachine,\n  state,\n  interpret\n} from 'https://unpkg.com/robot3@0.2.9/machine.js';\n\nconst mr_robot = createMachine({\n  idle: state(),\n  loading: state()\n});\n\nIn here each state is a key in the \"setup object\" that we pass to createMachine, but also notice that it needs to be a state object, which we create with the state function.\nNow we need transitions. Our idle state will switch to loading if a fetch event happens, loading will go back to idle if a done is dispatched. \n import {\n  createMachine,\n  state,\n+ transition,\n  interpret\n } from 'https://unpkg.com/robot3@0.2.9/machine.js';\n\nconst mr_robot = createMachine({\n-  idle: state(),\n-  loading: state()\n+  idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n+  loading: state(transition('done', 'idle'))\n });\n\ntransition is the thing that connects our states. It's first parameter is the name of the event that will trigger the transition, the second parameter is the \"destination\" state it will switch to. The rest of transition's parameters can be a list of function that will be executed when this transition is triggered.\nLooks lovely, but uhm... how do we test it? The machine by itself doesn't do anything. We need to give our new machine to the interpret function which will give us a \"service\" that can dispatch events. To prove that we are actually doing something we'll also give a handler to interpret, it will be like a 'onchange', it will listen to state changes.\nconst handler = ({ machine }) =&gt; {\n  console.log(machine.current);\n}\n\nconst { send } = interpret(mr_robot, handler);\n\nNow you can see if it's alive.\nsend('fetch');\nsend('fetch');\nsend('fetch');\nsend('done');\n\n// You should see in the console\n// loading (3)\n// idle\n\nDispatching fetch will turn the current state to loading and done will get it back to idle. I see you're not impressed. That's fine. Let's try something, let's add another state end and make loading switch to that, then dispatch done and see what happens. \n const mr_robot = createMachine({\n   idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n-   loading: state(transition('done', 'idle'))\n+   loading: state(transition('done', 'end')),\n+   end: state()\n });\nsend('done');\n\n// You should see in the console\n// idle\n\nSending done while idle doesn't trigger a loading state, it stays in idle because that state doesn't have a done event. And now...\n// We do the usual flow.\n\nsend('fetch');\nsend('done');\n\n// You should have\n// loading\n// end\n\n// Now try again `fetch`\nsend('fetch');\n\n// You should have\n// end\n\nIf you send fetch (or any other event) while in end state will give you end every single time. Why? Because you can't go anywhere, end doesn't have transitions.\nI hope you see why this is useful. If not, I apologise for all the console.loging.\nGoing back to our current machine. This what we got so far.\n import {\n  createMachine,\n  state,\n  transition,\n  interpret\n} from 'https://unpkg.com/robot3@0.2.9/machine.js';\n\nconst mr_robot = createMachine({\n  idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n  loading: state(transition('done', 'idle'))\n});\n\nconst handler = ({ machine }) =&gt; {\n  console.log(machine.current);\n}\n\nconst { send } = interpret(mr_robot, handler);\n\nBut this is still not enough, now we need to get some data when we enter the loading state. Let's first fake our quote fetching function.\nfunction get_quote() {\n  // make a random delay, 3 to 5 seconds.\n  const delay = random_number(3, 5) * 1000;\n\n  const promise = new Promise(res =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; res('&lt;quote&gt;'), delay);\n  });\n  \n  // sanity check\n  promise.then(res =&gt; (console.log(res), res));\n\n  return promise;\n}\n\nTo make it work with our state machine we will use a function called invoke, this utility calls an \"async function\" (a function that returns a promise) when you enter a state then when the promise resolves it sends a done event (if it fails it sends a error event).\n  import {\n   createMachine,\n   state,\n+  invoke,\n   transition,\n   interpret\n } from 'https://unpkg.com/robot3@0.2.9/machine.js';\n\n const mr_robot = createMachine({\n   idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n-  loading: state(transition('done', 'idle')),\n+  loading: invoke(get_quote, transition('done', 'idle')),\n });\n\nIf you test send('fetch') you should see in the console.\nloading\n\n// wait a few seconds...\n\n&lt;quote&gt;\nidle\n\nBy now I hope you're all wondering where do we actually keep the data? There is a handy feature in createMachine that let us define a \"context\" object that will be available to us in the function that we attach to our transitions.\nconst context = ev =&gt; ({\n  data: {},\n});\n  const mr_robot = createMachine({\n    idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n    loading: invoke(get_quote, transition('done', 'idle')),\n- });\n+ }, context);\n\nNext we'll use another utility. We will pass a third parameter to loading's transition, a hook of some sort that will modify the context object. This utility is called reduce and it looks like this.\nreduce((ctx, ev) =&gt; ({ ...ctx, data: ev.data }))\n\nIt takes the current context, a payload (here named ev) and whatever you return from it becomes your new context. We add that to the loading state.\n  import {\n   createMachine,\n   state,\n   invoke,\n   transition,\n+  reduce,\n   interpret\n } from 'https://unpkg.com/robot3@0.2.9/machine.js';\n\n const mr_robot = createMachine({\n   idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n-  loading: invoke(get_quote, transition('done', 'idle')), \n+  loading: invoke(\n+    get_quote, \n+    transition(\n+      'done',\n+      'idle',\n+      reduce((ctx, ev) =&gt; ({ ...ctx, data: ev.data }))\n+    )\n+  ),\n }, context);\n\nSanity check time. How do we know that works? We modify interpret's handler.\nconst handler = ({ machine, context }) =&gt; {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify({ \n    state: machine.current,\n    context\n  }));\n}\n\nYou should see this.\n{'state':'loading','context':{'data':{}}}\n\n// wait a few seconds...\n\n{'state':'idle','context':{'data':'&lt;quote&gt;'}}\n\nWe are ready. Let's show something in the browser.\n&lt;main id=\"app\" class=\"card\"&gt;\n  &lt;section id=\"card\" class=\"card__content\"&gt;\n     &lt;div class=\"card__body\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"card__quote\"&gt;\n          quote\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"card__author\"&gt;\n          -- author\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"card__footer\"&gt;\n        &lt;button id=\"load_btn\" class=\"btn btn--new\"&gt;\n          More\n        &lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn--tweet\"&gt;\n          Tweet\n        &lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;/section&gt; \n&lt;/main&gt;\nbody {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  min-height: 95vh;\n  background: #ddd;\n  font-size: 1em;\n  color: #212121;\n}\n\n.card {\n  width: 600px;\n  background: white;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 2px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\n}\n\n.card__content {\n  color: #212121;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card__content--loader {\n  height: 95px;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center\n}\n\n.card__body {\n padding-bottom: 15px;\n}\n\n.card__author {\n  padding-top: 10px;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n\n.card__footer {\n  width: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n}\n\n.btn {\n  color: #fff;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  margin-top: 10px;\n  margin-left: 10px;\n  border-radius: 0.4rem;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  padding: .3rem .9rem;\n}\n\n.btn--new {\n  background-color: #2093be;\n  border: 0.1rem solid #2093be;\n  \n}\n\n.btn--tweet {\n  background-color: #0074d9;\n  border: 0.1rem solid #0074d9;\n}\n\n.btn:hover {\n  background: #3cb0fd;\n  border: 0.1rem solid #3cb0fd;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n\n.hide {\n  display: none;\n}\n\nNow the last piece of the puzzle, the side effects. We need to attach another function to our transitions so we can update the DOM. We could use reduce again but is just rude to have side effects on something called reduce (just don't) We will bring another utility made for that, action.\nBut first we must prepare. Update the context object with the necesary dependencies. (This step is not necesary, this is just me being allergic to global variables)\n const context = ev =&gt; ({\n   data: {},\n+  dom: {\n+    quote: document.querySelector('.card__quote'),\n+    author: document.querySelector('.card__author'),\n+    load_btn: window.load_btn,\n+    tweet_btn: document.querySelector('.btn--tweet'),\n+    card: window.card\n+  }\n });\n\nCreate the side effects. At this point you should make sure that get_quote actually returns an object with a quote and author property.\nfunction update_card({ dom, data }) {\n  dom.load_btn.textContent = 'More';\n  dom.quote.textContent = data.quote;\n  dom.author.textContent = data.author;\n\n  const web_intent = 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=';\n  const tweet = `${data.quote} -- ${data.author}`;\n  dom.tweet_btn.setAttribute(\n    'href', web_intent + encodeURIComponent(tweet)\n  );\n}\n\nfunction show_loading({ dom }) {\n  dom.load_btn.textContent = 'Loading...';\n}\n\nPut everything together.\n  import {\n   createMachine,\n   state,\n   invoke,\n   transition,\n   reduce,\n+  action,\n   interpret\n } from 'https://unpkg.com/robot3@0.2.9/machine.js';\n\n const mr_robot = createMachine({\n-  idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading')),\n+  idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading', action(show_loading))),\n   loading: invoke(\n     get_quote, \n     transition(\n       'done',\n       'idle',\n       reduce((ctx, ev) =&gt; ({ ...ctx, data: ev.data })),\n+      action(update_card)\n     )\n   ),\n }, context);\n\nBy now everything kinda works but it looks bad when it loads for the first time. Let's make another loader, one that hides the card while we fetch the first quote.\nLet's start with the HTML.\n &lt;main id=\"app\" class=\"card\"&gt;\n-  &lt;section id=\"card\" class=\"card__content\"&gt;\n+  &lt;section class=\"card__content card__content--loader\"&gt; \n+    &lt;p&gt;Loading&lt;/p&gt; \n+  &lt;/section&gt;\n+  &lt;section id=\"card\" class=\"hide card__content\"&gt;\n     &lt;div class=\"card__body\"&gt;\n       &lt;div class=\"card__quote\"&gt;\n         quote\n       &lt;/div&gt;\n\n       &lt;div class=\"card__author\"&gt;\n          -- author\n       &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;div class=\"card__footer\"&gt;\n       &lt;button id=\"load_btn\" class=\"btn btn--new\"&gt;\n         More\n       &lt;/button&gt;\n       &lt;a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn--tweet\"&gt;\n         Tweet\n       &lt;/a&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt; \n   &lt;/section&gt; \n &lt;/main&gt;\n\nWe'll make another state, empty. We can reuse our original loading state for this. Make a factory function that returns the loading transition.\nconst load_quote = (...args) =&gt;\n  invoke(\n    get_quote,\n    transition(\n      'done',\n      'idle',\n      reduce((ctx, ev) =&gt; ({ ...ctx, data: ev.data })),\n      ...args\n    ),\n    transition('error', 'idle')\n  );\n const mr_robot = createMachine({\n   idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading', action(show_loading))),\n-  loading: invoke(\n-    get_quote, \n-    transition(\n-      'done',\n-      'idle',\n-      reduce((ctx, ev) =&gt; ({ ...ctx, data: ev.data })),\n-      action(update_card)\n-    )\n-  ),\n+  loading: load_quote(action(update_card))\n }, context);\n\nNow we use this to hide the first loader and show the quote when it's ready.\n const context = ev =&gt; ({\n   data: {},\n   dom: {\n     quote: document.querySelector('.card__quote'),\n     author: document.querySelector('.card__author'),\n+    loader: document.querySelector('.card__content--loader'),\n     load_btn: window.load_btn,\n     tweet_btn: document.querySelector('.btn--tweet'),\n     card: window.card\n   }\n });\nfunction hide_loader({ dom }) {\n  dom.loader.classList.add('hide');\n  dom.card.classList.remove('hide');\n}\n const mr_robot = createMachine({\n+  empty: load_quote(action(update_card), action(hide_loader)),\n   idle: state(transition('fetch', 'loading', action(show_loading))),\n   loading: load_quote(action(update_card))\n }, context);\n-\n- const handler = ({ machine, context }) =&gt; {\n-  console.log(JSON.stringify({ \n-    state: machine.current,\n-    context\n-  }));\n- }\n+ const handler = () =&gt; {};\n\n const { send } = interpret(mr_robot, handler);\n+\n+ const fetch_quote = () =&gt; send('fetch');\n+\n+ window.load_btn.addEventListener('click', fetch_quote);\n\nLet's see it work.\n\n  \n    See the Pen Finite Random Quote Machine by Heiker (@VonHeikemen) on CodePen.\n  \n\n\nSo is this state machine thing helpful?\nI hope so. Did you notice we made a bunch of test and created the blueprint of the quote machine even before writing any HTML? I think that's cool. \nDid you try to click the 'loading' button while loading? Did it triggered a bunch of call to get_quote? That is because we made (sort of) impossible that a fetch event can happen during loading. \nNot only that, the behavior of the machine is and the effects on the outside world are separated. Depending on how you like to write code that may be a good or a bad thing.\nWant to know more?\n\nXState (concepts)\nrobot3 - docs\nUnderstanding State Machines\n\n","id":"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/taking-a-look-at-finite-state-machine/","title":"Taking a look at finite state machines"}},"docInfo":{"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/en/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/dealing-with-side-effects-and-pure-functions-in-javascript/":{"body":903,"title":6},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/functional-programming-for-your-everyday-javascript-partial-application/":{"body":824,"title":6},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/functional-programming-for-your-everyday-javascript-the-power-of-map/":{"body":1011,"title":6},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/functional-programming-for-your-everyday-javascript-using-a-maybe/":{"body":1432,"title":6},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/homemade-observables/":{"body":1210,"title":2},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/lenses-a-k-a-composable-getters-and-setters/":{"body":1287,"title":5},"https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/web-development/taking-a-look-at-finite-state-machine/":{"body":1143,"title":5}},"length":10}};
